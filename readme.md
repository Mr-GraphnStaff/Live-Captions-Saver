The MS Teams Live Captions Saver (SaveAs Fork) builds on the original extension, adding new functionality and customizations.  

## Current Enhancements
- `saveAs` option → lets users choose where transcripts are saved instead of forcing the default Downloads folder.
- Save behavior controls with optional custom download folder support.
- Streamlined popup optimized for Microsoft Teams PWA with touch-friendly actions.
- Lean export workflow focused on TXT and Markdown with simplified copy options.
- Enhanced filename variables and timestamp preferences, including relative timers for meetings.

## Planned Enhancements
- Quick filters for session history (search by meeting title or date).
- Optional transcript trimming for long-running meetings.
- Additional visual themes for light/dark PWA environments.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) **18.x or newer** (required by the tooling in this fork)
- npm **9.x or newer** (bundled with recent Node releases)

### Install Tooling
```bash
npm install
```

### Common Tasks
- `npm run lint` → Runs a lightweight manifest and asset check to confirm required files are present
- `npm run start` → Launches the extension in a Chromium browser via `web-ext run`. Use `CHROMIUM_BIN=/path/to/browser npm run start` if automatic detection fails.
- `npm run build` → Creates a production-ready ZIP in `dist/` using `web-ext build`

### Manual Loading for Local Testing
You can still load the unpacked extension directly:
1. Run `npm run build` **or** use the `teams-captions-saver/` folder.
2. Open the extensions page in your browser (`chrome://extensions`, `edge://extensions`, or `brave://extensions`).
3. Enable **Developer mode**.
4. Choose **Load unpacked** and point to the `teams-captions-saver/` directory or select the generated ZIP in `dist/`.
